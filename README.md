# styled-ppx

**styled-ppx** is the [ppx](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/ppx.html) that brings typed styled components to Reason, OCaml and ReScript.

Build on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh), it allows you to style apps safe, quickly, performant and as you always done it.

</p>

Allows you to create **React Components** with type-safe style definitions that don't rely on a different [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) than CSS.

### Getting started

Depends on [bs-css with bs-css-emotion](https://github.com/giraud/bs-css), [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) or [rescript-react](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-react), make sure you have them installed first.

#### Install

```bash
yarn add @davesnx/styled-ppx
# Or
npm install @davesnx/styled-ppx
```

#### Update `bsconfig.json`

Add the PPX in your `bsconfig.json` file under `"ppx-flags"`

```diff
{
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "reason-react",
    "bs-css",
    "bs-css-emotion"
  ],
+  "ppx-flags": ["@davesnx/styled-ppx/ppx"]
}
```

#### Use 
##### with Reason
```reason
module Link = [%styled.a (~color="#4299E1") => {|
  font-size: 1.875rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 10px 0px;
  color: $(color);
|}];

module Layout = [%styled.div [|
  [%css "display: flex"],
  [%css "width: 100%;"],
  [%css "height: 100%;"],
  [%css "justify-content: center;"],
  [%css "align-items: center"],
|]];

/* Later on a component */
<Layout>
  <Link
    color="#333333"
    href="https://sancho.dev"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  />
  <span className={[%cx "color: black; position: absolute; left: 0px;"]}>
    {React.string("sancho.dev")}
  </span>
</Layout>
```

##### with Rescript
```rescript
module Link = %styled.a(`
  font-size: 1.875rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 10px 0px;
`)
```

### Editor Support

One of the downsites of using a `ppx` is their editor support, we provide a VSCode extension that brings syntax highlight. This can include in the future, CSS autocomplete and other CSS-related extensions.

Install the VSCode extension: **[VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx)**

> If you are interested on another editor, please [fill an issue](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx/issues/new).
