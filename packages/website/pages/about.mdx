# Motivation

There are a few reasons why this project exists and why came to live.

### There was a need
In my experience, writing React with a CSS-in-JS library is one of the best combos for writing scalable design systems, UI libraries and applications. When I discovered Reason back in the days (arround 2018), it wasn't possible to bind to styled-components neither emotion. Even ([a](https://reasonml.chat/t/idiomatic-way-to-bind-to-styled-components/886) [f](https://reasonml.chat/t/styled-components-possible/554)[e](https://reasonml.chat/t/styling-solutions-reasonreact-as-of-aug-18/958)[w](https://reasonml.chat/t/options-and-best-practices-for-styling-in-reasonreact/261) [p](https://twitter.com/lyovson/status/1233397294311100417)[e](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[o](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[p](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[l](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[e](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/how-to-create-bindings-for-emotion-styled/2995) were asking for it.

During that time, there were a few efforts on bringing type-safety on top of CSS with [bs-css](https://github.com/giraud/bs-css) or [bs-emotion](https://github.com/ahrefs/bs-emotion). Even thought I liked that approach, it had a few drawbacks:
- The need for learning a new DSL on top of CSS was tedious. Very fancy for simple properties, but almost impossible for more complex ones (a classic example `width: calc(100% - 20px){:css}` became `CssJs.width(calc(min, percent(100.), px(20)));{:rescript}`). For the real world usage I endup using `CssJs.property("property", "value")` most of the times.
- The runtime is huge. The bundle-size of bs-css starts with 64kb and goes up considerably with the usage and ReScript death code elimiation.
- The fact about having a runtime involved to only write safe CSS doesn't seem like a nice trade-off.

### It's possible
Embedding CSS inside Reason/OCaml seemed like a bad idea at first, mostly since most CSS-in-JS solutions that use native CSS relied on a JavaScript feature that isn't available in Reason [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

After discovering what a ppx was (*"a mechanism to embed other languages inside Reason"*), and it could mimic the template literals, I jumped straight into hacking a prototype that became this project.

Embedding languages inside others, isn't a new concept, has been happening for a long time. In fact, the most common case of an embedded language is usually CSS inside HTML.
Using CSS enables all sort of integrations: Editors, DevTools, prototyping tools, Github Copilot, etc. Even for designers that don't want to understand neither care about ReScript.

### It can bring more features than the JS
Enabling type-safety into CSS is more like a nice to have, rather than a hard requirement. Features that aren't implemented but are on the horizon are mostly related in extracting the CSS from the runtime and keep it in a separate file. Forcing to have a zero run-time application. Provide a safe way to access a shared theme without having to worry about the runtime, would be a killer feature, that I wished I had before.

To know more about how it works or what are the benefits I recommend to watch [my talk at ReasonSTHLM Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekHCBZiCviM).

## Credits

Here's a list of people that helped me and couldn't make it without them:

- [Javier Chávarri](https://github.com/jchavarri): for the introduction to Reason. Teaching me all his knowledge about OCaml, AST, ppx rewritters and the help of boostrapping the project.
- [Alessandro Strada](https://github.com/astrada): this project started with inspiration from [bs-css-ppx](https://github.com/astrada/ppx_bs_css)
- [Eduardo Rafael](https://github.com/EduardoRFS/): to teach me how to write a compiler and a type-checker. His initial implementation of the CSS Value definition and the parser combinator.
- [Rizo](https://github.com/rizo): for the help with the API design, discussions and great conversations about styling and CSS.
- [Max Lantas](https://github.com/mnxn): for implementing the VSCode extension.
- This project builds on a long line of earlier work by clever folks in the JavaScript community from around the world. People from [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), [compiledcssinjs](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled), [linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), and many more.
