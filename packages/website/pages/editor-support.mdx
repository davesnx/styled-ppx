# Editor Support

One of the downsides of embedding a language (CSS) into another language (<Res>ReScript</Res><Re>Reason</Re>) is the limited editor support. Because of that, we provide an editor extension that brings syntax highlighting for the CSS inside the styled-ppx notation.

## VSCode Extension

Install the **[VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx)** via the marketplace or via the command line:

```bash
ext install davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx
```

## Vim Plugin

Install the vim plugin with VimPlug, Vundle or Pathogen:

### with VimPlug
Add `Plug 'ahrefs/vim-styled-ppx'` to your `~/.vimrc` and run PlugInstall.

### with Vundle
Add `Plugin 'ahrefs/vim-styled-ppx'` to your `~/.vimrc` and run PluginInstall.

### with Pathogen
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ahrefs/vim-styled-ppx ~/.vim/bundle/vim-log-highlighting
```
