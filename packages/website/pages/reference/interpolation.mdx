# Interpolation

Interpolation allows to use any identifier as a value inside CSS. "any identifier" refers to any ReScript variables or [module accessors](https://rescript-lang.org/try?code=LYewJgrgNgpgBAFQBY2PAvHA3gKDnWAFzgHMAnGATzkwGEBnegKXoDoUAPACgCIAhAKJ8AInwAcPAJQ4AvjiA).

Useful for reusing variables, handling themes or conditionally apply styles based on props at run-time.

```rescript
module Component = %styled.div(`
  border: 1px solid $(Theme.black);
`)
```

```rescript
module Component = %styled.div(`
  max-width: $(maxWidth);
`)
```

Interpolation works inside values, media-queries and selectors. It doesn't work for entire properties or any interpolation, which is slightly different from SASS/Less and other JavaScript-based solutions (such as styled-components or emotion) their interpolation is more dynamic and can be used everywhere.

<Callout>
  Don't confuse interpolation from [String Interpolation from ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/primitive-types#string-interpolation).
</Callout>

The rules for interpolation works the same way as [CSS variables](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#using-variables) (`var(){:css}`);

**styled-ppx** forces you to be more rigit, with the promise of being type-safe, the same way as ReScript does ❤️. The dynamism from JavaScript-based solutions comes with the cost of unsafety.

Here's an example: `margin-${whatever}: 10px` is valid in JavaScript, while isn't valid in **styled-ppx**. As explained above, this interpolation can't be applied to entire **properties**, neither half-properties.

The solution is simple, you would handle all properties based on the dynamic value:

```rescript
let margin = direction =>
  switch direction {
  | Left => %css("margin-left: 10px;")
  | Right => %css("margin-right: 10px;")
  | Top => %css("margin-top: 10px;")
  | Bottom => %css("margin-bottom: 10px;")
  }
```

If you aren't familiar with `%css{:rescript}` extension, take a look [in the `%css` section](./css)

## Example

Any value from any property can be interpolated. It relies on the position of the interpolation to guess which value you are trying to interpolate.

```rescript
module Size = {
  let small = CssJs.px(10)
}

margin: $(Size.small); // -> margin: 10px;
margin: $(Size.small) 0; // -> margin: 10px 0;
margin: $(Size.small) $(Size.small); // -> margin: 10px 10px;
```

## Features

- Type-safety via type holes
- Support for shorthand properties and interpolate on a value

## Type-safety

We introduced here the API from [`CssJs`](./runtime) to define the value of `margin`. We expect you to use it to make sure the values are interpoilated with the right type. In the example above `margin` expects one of:

```rescript
auto | ch(float) | em(float) | ex(float) | rem(float) | vh(float) | vw(float) | vmin(float) | vmax(float) | px(int) | pxFloat(float) | cm(float) | mm(float) | inch(float) | pc(float) | pt(int) | zero | calc([ | add | sub], t, t) | percent(float)`
```

Since `Size.small{:rescript}` is `px(int){:rescript}`, the type-checker would allow it.

## A note about polymorphism of CSS

There are plenty of properties on CSS that accept different types of values, the ones encountered challenging are `animation`, `box-shadow`/`text-shadow`, `background`, `transition` and `transform` to name a few. Not because are shorthand properties, but because they have values that are positional and optional at the same time.

Let's look at `background`.

```css
background: #fff; /* The background is white */
background: url(img.png); /* The background is an image */
background: #fff url(img.png); /* The background is white with an image */
background: url(img.png) no-repeat; /* The background is a non-repeating image */
```

In this case, to interpolate the background's value like: `background: $(variable1) $(variable2)` the type-checker can't know the type of `$(variable1)` and `(variable2)` ahead of time, since there's a few possibilities of `background` valid. This is called [overload](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/by-example.html#overloaded-functions) in other languages and it's not available in ReScript to it's nature of a static typed language.

## What if a property isn't supported

First, if you have the time, please [open an issue](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx/issues/new). Most properties are trivial to add support for.
If time isn't your best friend: There's a workaround for unsupported properties.

There's no way to add unsafe behaviour on CSS definitions. Prefer to keep improving the overall safety via requests/issues than allowing a method for unsafe to all. It will loose the purpose of **styled-ppx**.

The workaround is to use the [Array API](./array) to generate `%cx{:rescript}` calls, like this example:

```rescript
let block: Css.Rule.t = %css("display: block")
let randomProperty = CssJs.unsafe("aspect-ratio", "21 / 9");
let picture = %cx([block, randomProperty]);
```

```rescript
let randomProperty = CssJs.unsafe("aspect-ratio", "21 / 9");
let picture = %styled.div([randomProperty]);
```

Here the lack of safety will rely on your usage of `CssJs.unsafe{:rescript}`.

For a general overview of the list take a look at [support for CSS](https://styled-ppx.vercel.app/css-support).

## Not valid interpolation

Interpolation in ppxes is a little limited, which makes a few "use-cases" not possible, for example: abstract a function or a variable reference.

```rescript
// 🔴 Can't pass a function
let fn = (~kind, ~big) => { /* ... */ };
%styled.div(fn)
```

```rescript
// 🔴 Can't pass a variable reference
let value = "display: block"
%styled.div(value)
```
