# Inject global styles

`%styled.global{:rescript}` is the method to apply general styles to your website.

```rescript
%styled.global(`
  html, body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
`)
```

Recommend to not add `@font-face{:css}` definitions as globals. Consider adding the font directly to the HTML or in a `style.css` file. [More](https://andydavies.me/blog/2019/02/12/preloading-fonts-and-the-puzzle-of-priorities/).

Since [emotion](https://emotion.sh) has a small run-time for those global styles to be applied to the DOM. In a regular style file this isn't an issue. Keeping `@fonts-face{:css}` or other `@imports{:css}` inside emotion will delay a bit their fetching and will cause a [Flash of Unstyled Text](https://css-tricks.com/fout-foit-foft/).
