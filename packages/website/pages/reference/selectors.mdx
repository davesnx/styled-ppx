# Selectors

The extensions `cx` and `styled` support selectors; on the other hand `css` does not because it only generates one Rule.

The syntax is similar to SASS but the only difference is that for nesting you need to use `&` in front of each selector.

```rescript
let link = %cx(`
  color: $(Color.Text.body);

  &:hover {
    color: $(Color.Text.accent);
  }
`)
```
```reason
let link = [%cx {|
  color: $(Color.Text.body);

  &:hover {
    color: $(Color.Text.accent);
  }
|}];
```
> Note: Selectors can be nested within your CSS which will be attached to the classname generated (in this case by `cx`)

More than one level of selectors is not supported. It might compile but it will generate the wrong result.

The support for selectors is CSS Selectors Level 3 and the more stable part of level 4 (currently in draft).

## Interpolation in selectors

It's useful to keep classnames unique, or to reference other classnames in styled-ppx, that's why we support interpolation in selectors.

```rescript
// Here `outlined` is a classname generated by `cx`, but it can be any string
let outlined = %cx(`
  padding: 4px;
  outline: 1px solid red;
`)

let link = %cx(`
  color: $(Color.Text.body);

  & .$(outlined) {
    padding: 0px;
  }
`)

<div className={link ++ " " ++ (isActive ? outlined : "")} />
```
```reason
// Here `outlined` is a classname generated by `cx`, but it can be any string
let outlined = [%cx {|
  padding: 4px;
  outline: 1px solid red;
|}];

let link = [%cx {|
  color: $(Color.Text.body);

  & .$(outlined) {
    padding: 0px;
  }
|}];

<div className={(link ++ " ") ++ (if (isActive) {outlined} else {""})} />;
```
