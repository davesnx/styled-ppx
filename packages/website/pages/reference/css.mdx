# Rule: `css` extension

Generates a `Css.rule{:rescript}` given a single CSS rule as string. The `%css` extension is useful with combination with the [Array API](./array), to compose and re-use rules.

## Example

```rescript
let rule: Css.rule = %css("display: block")
```

## Features

- Only single properties are allowed. Declaratiosn aren't. Declarations can contain selectors, rules only a pair of property/value. If you need a selector or more than one rule, use `%cx{:rescript}` instead.
- The semi-colon in the last position is optional. `display: block;{:css}` and `display: block{:css}` are the same.
- Curly braces aren't allowed. `{ display: block }{:css}` isn't valid.
