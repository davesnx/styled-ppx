# Rule: `css` extension

Generates a `Css.rule{:rescript}` given a single CSS rule as string. The `%css` extension is useful in combination with the [Array API](./array) to compose and re-use rules.

## Example

```rescript
let rule: Css.rule = %css("display: block")
```

## Features

- Only single properties are allowed, e.g., `color: blue`, and multiple declarations, e.g., `:hover { color: blue}` or `color: blue; background-color: red`, are not allowed. If you need to use a selector or use more than one rule, use `%cx{:rescript}` instead.
- The semi-colon in the last position is optional. `display: block;{:css}` and `display: block{:css}` are the same.
- Curly braces aren't allowed. `{ display: block }{:css}` isn't valid.
