# Frequently asked questions

## Does it support ReScript, Reason and OCaml syntax?

Yes, all are supported. Since the ppx transformation operates on the AST and all of those languages share the majority of the AST, it's possible to support all of them. Note that, ReScript has been challenging since they are exploring new patterns of the language and are diverging from the OCaml AST.

You can use the language selector in the sidebar to switch between the different syntaxes. All snippets on this page are written in Reason and ReScript.

As well, our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx) supports ReScript, Reason, and OCaml syntaxes.
