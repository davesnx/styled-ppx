### styled components with type-safe CSS for ReScript, Melange and Native

**styled-ppx** is a [ppx](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-09-an-introduction-to-ocaml-ppx-ecosystem) and a library that brings styled components to ReScript, Melange and Native. Create **React Components** with type-safe style definitions with only CSS.

It allows you to style apps safely, quickly, and performant - just as you always done it.

```rescript
module Center = %styled.div(`
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
`)

<Center> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </Center>
```
```reason
module Center = [%styled.div {|
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
|}];

<Center> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </Center>
```

## Type-safe CSS

styled-ppx comes with its own CSS Parser and CSS type-checker, so you can write CSS and be sure it will be valid and all types will be correct. This is a **huge** time-saver when working at large scale with CSS.

## Features

- **Zero abstraction over CSS**
- **Component-based styling**
- Supports the power of the underlying language: pattern-matching, composition, labelled arguments, static type-safety.
- Implements utilities such as `cx` to generate classNames and `css` to generate `Css.rule`
- Supports [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/), [Melange](https://melange.re) and [native](/getting-started/native.mdx).
- Integrates with [`@rescript-react`](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction), [`reason-react`](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/), and [`server-reason-react`](https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/server-reason-react)
- It can also work without React
- Adds labels on the className hashes for better DX

The main part of **styled-ppx** is a ppx. Generally speaking, a ppx is the system from OCaml to have some sort of macros. A small program that run before the compilation, and can transform your source-code.

They are similar to [babel plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/).

In this case, expands those extensions (e.g., `%styled.div{:rescript}` `[%styled.div]{:reason}`, `%cx{:rescript}` `[%cx]{:reason}` and `%css{:rescript}` `[%css]{:reason}`) into valid code.

You can learn more about it in [Tarides blog: Introduction to OCaml ppx ecosystem](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-09-an-introduction-to-ocaml-ppx-ecosystem).
