# Typed styled components for ReScript

**styled-ppx** is the [ppx](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-09-an-introduction-to-ocaml-ppx-ecosystem) that brings typed styled components to ReScript, allowing you to create **React Components** with type-safe style definitions that look like good old CSS.

styled-ppx is built on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh), so you can style your apps in a safe, familiar, and performant way.

```rescript
module Center = %styled.div(`
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
`)

<Center> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </Center>
```
```reason
module Center = [%styled.div {|
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
|}];

<Center> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </Center>;
```

## Highlights

- Type-safe CSS
- Component-based styling
- Implements utility helpers such as `classname` and `css`
- There's no abstraction over standard CSS - it's neither a new language nor a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
- Supports the power of the underlying language: pattern-matching, composition, labelled arguments, etc
- Built on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh)

**styled-ppx** is a ppx. You can learn more about ppxs in [Tarides blog: Introduction to OCaml ppx ecosystem](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-09-an-introduction-to-ocaml-ppx-ecosystem). Generally speaking, they are similar to [babel plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/). They run before the compilation of your code, and expands styled-ppx notations (e.g., `%styled.div{:rescript}` `[%styled.div]{:reason}` or `%cx{:rescript}` `[%cx]{:reason}`) into valid ReScript code.
