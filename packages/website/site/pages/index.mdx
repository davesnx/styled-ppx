# Typed styled components for ReScript, Melange and Native

**styled-ppx** is a [ppx](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-09-an-introduction-to-ocaml-ppx-ecosystem) and a library that brings styled components to ReScript, Melange and Native. It allows you to create **React Components** with type-safe style definitions that don't rely on a different language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) except CSS, but also can be used without React.

Built on top of [emotion](https://emotion.sh), it allows you to style apps safely, quickly, and performantly - just as you have always done it.

```rescript
module Center = %styled.div(`
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
`)

<Center> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </Center>
```
```reason
module Center = [%styled.div {|
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
|}];

<Center> {React.string("Hello from the future!")} </Center>;
```

## Highlights

- Type-safe CSS
- Component-based styling
- Implements utilities such as `cx` to generate classNames and `css` to generate `Css.rules`
- 0 abstraction over standard CSS - it's neither a new language nor a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
- Supports the power of the underlying language: pattern-matching, composition, labelled arguments, etc
- Integrates with [reason-react], [@resript-react] and [server-reason-react], accordingly
- Adds labels for better DX

The main part of **styled-ppx** is a ppx. You can learn more about it in [Tarides blog: Introduction to OCaml ppx ecosystem](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-05-09-an-introduction-to-ocaml-ppx-ecosystem). Generally speaking, they are similar to [babel plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins/). They run before the compilation of your code, to transform your source-code. In this case, expands styled-ppx notations (e.g., `%styled.div{:rescript}` `[%styled.div]{:reason}` or `%cx{:rescript}` `[%cx]{:reason}`) into valid ReScript code.
