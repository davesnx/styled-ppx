# CSS

> This page is a work in progress

Since [v0.40](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx/releases/tag/0.40.0) styled-ppx exposes a module called `CSS`, the runtime.

It's used by the ppx transformation, but can be used to construct values for CSS properties.

The library is available<Res> as a rescript packages `@davesnx/syled-ppx/css` and `@davesnx/syled-ppx/emotion`.</Res><Re>:</Re>
<Re>
- For Melange users, as dune library with `(modes melange)`: `styled-ppx.melange`
- For native users, as dune library: `styled-ppx.native`
</Re>

## Usage

```reason
let small = CSS.px(10);
// Creates a CSS.length type, valid on any CSS property that accepts a length value

// Now, `small` can be interpolated in `[%cx ..]`, `[%css ..]` or `[%styled.tag ..]` annotation
let classname = [%cx {|margin: $(small)|}];
```
```rescript
let small = CSS.px(10)
// Creates a CSS.length type, valid on any CSS property that accepts a length value

// Now, `small` can be interpolated in `[%cx ..]`, `[%css ..]` or `[%styled.tag ..]` annotation
let classname = %cx(`margin: $(small)`)
```

## API

### Values

All CSS values are available as <Res>ReScript</Res><Re>Reason</Re> values

```reason
let ten = CSS.px(10);
let position = CSS.block;
```
```rescript
let ten = CSS.px(10)
let position = CSS.block
```

but also as polymorphic variants and both are interchangeable

```reason
let ten = `px(10); // or CSS.px(10), they are aliases
let position = `block; // or CSS.block, they are aliases
```
```rescript
let ten = #px(10) // or CSS.px(10), they are aliases
let position = #block // or CSS.block, they are aliases
```

### Properties

All CSS properties are available as camelCased functions.

When using the [Array API](/reference/array) can be handy to manually create properties. If you are using the ppx transformation, there's no need, since the ppx generates them under the hood.

```reason
let faded = CSS.opacity(0.9);
```
```rescript
let faded = CSS.opacity(0.9)
```

Some properties accept just a float, like `CSS.opacity` but there are many properties that accept more complex values, like `CSS.flex`.

```reason
let basic = CSS.flex(1.0, 1.0, `px(100));
```
```rescript
let basic = CSS.flex(1.0, 1.0, #px(100))
```

or simply a polyvariant

```reason
let row = CSS.display(`flex);
```
```rescript
let row = CSS.display(#flex)
```
