# Frequently asked questions

## Does it support ReScript, Reason and OCaml syntax?

Yes, all are supported. Since the ppx operates on the AST and all of those languages share the majority of the AST, we are able to support all of them. Note that, supporting ReScript has been challenging because they are exploring new patterns of the language that are not compatible with the OCaml AST.

Also, our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx) supports ReScript, Reason, and OCaml syntaxes.

The differences are around syntaxes are the string delimiters:

Reason and OCaml uses `"` and `{||}`, while ReScript uses ```. We recommend that you use `{||}` when it's a multi-line string.

You can use the language selector in the sidebar to switch between the different syntaxes. All snippets on this page are written in Reason and ReScript.
