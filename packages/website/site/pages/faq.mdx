# Frequently asked questions

## Does it support Reason and OCaml syntax?

Yes, both are supported. Even though code snippets are written in ReScript (for the sake of simplicity), you can still use Reason and OCaml syntaxes. Since it is meant to be used in a browser, **styled-ppx** follows the same restrictions as ReScript.

Also, our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx) supports ReScript, Reason, and OCaml syntaxes.

The differences are around syntaxes are the string delimiters:
Reason and OCaml uses `"` and `{||}`, while ReScript uses ```. We recommend that you use `{||}` when it's a multi-line string.
